## Guess the Number Game
Run `python3 guess_the_number.py` to play a simple number guessing game.
The game shows a banner with colors when it starts and gives feedback after each guess.
You can customize the range and number of attempts:

First, install the requirement:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python3 guess_the_number.py --min 1 --max 50 --attempts 5
```
At the end of your session, a small summary with your results will be displayed.
